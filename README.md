# Ordering-Microservice-Platform

The Ordering-Microservice-Platform is a production-ready suite of microservices designed using Spring, Spring Boot, and Spring Cloud frameworks. This platform demonstrates the use of modern microservices patterns and practices to create a resilient, secure, and scalable e-commerce ordering system.

## Features

- **Configuration Management**: Utilizes Spring Cloud Config Server for externalizing configuration management across microservices.
  
- **Service Discovery and Registration**: Implements the Service Discovery and Registration pattern using Netflix's Eureka server.
  
- **Resilience**: Incorporates the RESILIENCE4J framework to build fault-tolerant microservices.
  
- **API Gateway**: Handles Cross-cutting concerns and internal routing using Spring Cloud Gateway.
  
- **Distributed Tracing & Log Aggregation**: Employs Zipkin for tracing requests across the distributed system and aggregating logs for monitoring and troubleshooting.
  
- **Microservices Security**: Secured microservices using OAuth2 with Okta as the identity management provider.
